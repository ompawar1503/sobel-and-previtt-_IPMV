The Sobel operator is a widely used method for edge detection that computes the gradient of an image in both the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions. The operator uses a pair of 3x3 convolution kernels, which are designed to detect edges in the image.
The Prewitt operator is another edge detection technique similar to the Sobel operator. It is also used to compute the gradient of an image, but its kernels are slightly different. The Prewitt operator uses 3x3 convolution kernels that are designed to detect edges in the horizontal and vertical directions.
